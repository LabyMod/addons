### Purpose
The idea behind this repository is quite simple:<br>
We want to provide a platform where community developers can create their addons together with other people.

Here you can collaborate with others, review their addons, improve them and if everything gets approved by our team, your addons will be merged into the master branch and therefore be available as approved addon in our Store.

### Workflow
Please have a look [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md#workflow) for diving into contribution.
