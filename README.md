### Purpose
The idea behind this repository is quite simple:<br>
We want to provide a platform where community developers can create their addons together with other people.

Here you can collaborate with others, review their addons, improve them and if everything gets approved by our team, your addons will be merged into the master branch and therefore be available as approved addon in our Store.

### Workflow
Please have a look [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md#workflow) for diving into contribution.

### Branches & Minecraft versions
For each Minecraft version that is supported by LabyMod, this repository has a branch where the PRs are being merged in.
Please study this carefully and decide to which branch you create your PR.
